#My former personal – portfolio application. What started as a site where I could showcase my work somewhat developed into my playground for new ideas. The hiding of the navbar on scroll is executed via a custom hook, the animation in the top section is an effect of using react-particles-js (custom configured). I have incorporated react-lazyload for the stats page (section below about) and a custom use-interval hook so that the numbers grow on the user’s screen when they arrive at that section. The ‘contact’ part of the page makes use of emailJS, which allows the user to send email messages to me from the level of the app. Validation (utils.js) is in place to ensure a massage is sent only when valid data is entered, and the user is notified of the result upon clicking the Submit button. Vast majority of the styling is done via CSS in an external file. Admittedly the fact that I kept adding new ideas and testing concepts led to the code of this application to being rather inelegant – especially the CSS portion. A notable improvement can be observed in my more recent work.
